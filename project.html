                        <p>In this class we used Cisco Packet Tracer to create Servers using virtual switches, computers, and routers.
                            We learned how to block ip's set up passwords for network protection, and various types of network connections.

                        <p>In this class we created our own lexer, our own programming language.
                            It was very simplistic but after the end of the semester we had made it so we could do math with random phrases.

                        <p>In this class we designed a full OS system with C on Linux. We made a terminal that could create and write into files, read back and delete the files, and many other commands.

                        <p>This Project I did for personal entertainment was modding a wii game I enjoyed as a kid.
                            I had updated everything in the game to be better, and I am continuing to improve it.
                            This project has been enjoyed by thousands of people since.
